The first cat show was held in London was at the Crystal Place in 1871.
The first cat show held in America was at Madison Square Garden in 1895.
The Egyptian name for cat was Mau. This also means "to see."
The classical Greek word for cat is ailouros.
Cats are said to have a sense of smell that is 30 times better than humans.
Cats enjoy the smell, and the effects, of catnip, but only if they've inherited the gene for it. For other cats, the smell may be intriguing, but catnip will have no effect.
Cats are born with their sense of smell functioning, and it is highly developed by about three weeks of age.
Their sense of smell means that felines can be sensitive to tainted food, and perhaps this has contributed to their finicky reputation.
The night vision of the feline is legendary. In order to see, they need only one-sixth as much light as a human. They cannot, however, see in total darkness. When enough light is not available, they use their whiskers to feel their way around.
Your kitty's eyes offer her almost 285 degrees of sight in three dimensions. Ideal peripheral vision for hunting.
Cats do see in color, and can distinguish yellow, blue, and green hues. Their eyes are best, however, at detecting movement, and shades of gray.
The feline eye has a third eyelid. Called the nictating membrane, or haw, it is designed to remove dust and dirt, and lubricate the eye. If there is illness or injury, the haw will show. Ironically, content and sleepy cats have been known to show haws as well.
With males weighing in at 15 to 20 pounds, the Ragdoll cat breed is the largest of all domestic cats.
Althought the Ragdoll is said to be the largest domestic cat breed, the largest cat on record is actually a member of another breed - the Maine Coon.
The breed to take "Best Cat" in the first cat show ever held in the US was a Maine Coon cat.
If historians are correct, and cats were first domesticated in Egypt, then the Egyptian Mau might be the oldest cat breed.
The tuxedo cat breed is not really a breed at all.
The calico cat breed is also not really a breed either, but a coat color. Because the genes responsible for certain colors in the coat are sex related, calicos are almost always female. Male calicos do exist, contrary to what some believe, but are often sterile.
The Norwegian Forest cat is a natural breed that is said to have accompanied Vikings on their long journeys at sea. If this is true, then they are (or descended from) one of the oldest breeds.
The Maine coon may share some ancestry with Norwegian Forest cats. If Vikings landed in North America, then it just may be that they brought the Norwegian Forest cats and left a few behind.
According to Americanhumane.org, the Persian cat has been the most popular breed in the United States since 1871.
Siamese cats have two large dark smudge marks on their backs. These are called "temple marks" and legend has it that they got there when a holy being picked up a Siamese and left the impression of his hands there forever.
Some sources have claimed that at one time, the Siamese cat was the number one breed in the US. Perhaps these statements have been made by meezer lovers.
Maine coon lovers have also claimed supremacy in the battle for most popular cat breed.
Larger cats are sometimes the least aggressive. The Main coon cat is referred to as a "gentle giant." Persians are said to be the most gentle of all breeds, but the Ragdoll (another large breed) may take that honor as it has an aversion to conflict. Ragdolls often play fight with claws retracted.
The Balinese cat breed is a natural long haired mutation of the Siamese cat.
Both the Balinese and Siamese are among the most intelligent of the domestic cat breeds.
There are both "traditional" and "modern" versions of a number of breeds, including the Balinese and Siamese. The traditional versions have different characteristics from the modern versions, such as coat length, and the size and shape of the body, head, and ears.
Cats tend to have short jaws, giving their bite lots of power. To kill prey, a bite into the neck with the canine teeth will do it. The cat will hold on until the animal suffocates.
Cats have thick hair around the pads of their feet, which allows them to remain silent while walking.
Unlike many animals, felines walk on their toes, enabling them to start into a run at any moment.
With a large kill, cats in the wild use their rough tongues to separate meat from bone.
Cats will often eat the entire body of small prey, crushing and ingesting bones for calcium, along with any vegetation the prey has consumed.
Cat species are found throughout the world.
Cats are good climbers and climb high into trees quickly. They get stuck in trees because their backward pointing claws don't help them to go down, only up.
All cats have a territory, including indoor cats. If you notice your cat pacing the house, she's probably on patrol.
When your cat rubs against you, she is actually marking you with her scent. Cats that live together will exchange scents with each other regularly, forming a communal scent. If one of your cats comes back from the veterinarian smelling funky, this can cause unrest in the house, and even some hissing. Starting with the cat that was not at the vet, rub everybody with the same cloth several times to spread the scent around.
Cats spend up to a third of their waking hours grooming themselves.
A cat can reach almost every part of its body with its barbed tongue.
Cats groom more actively (and sometimes over-groom) when they are anxious. It tends to help them relieve tension. They also groom to cool off in hot weather and after activity.
Cats love to sun bathe, and sunlight on the fur produces vitamin D. During grooming the fur provides vitamin D nourishment.
During self-grooming, scratching with the back legs helps to dislodge any parasites from the fur and skin. It also helps to get the difficult to clean areas of the head, neck, and shoulders.
Adult cat tongues have rows of hooked, backward-pointing projections called papillae. These barbs latch onto food and fluids, and give the cat's tongue a sandpaper feel. Newborn kittens only have papillae around the edge of the tongue.
Cats drink fluids by curling their tongues into the shape of a spoon. The barbs on their tongues help scoop the water as they flick it to the backs of their mouths, swallowing every few laps.
Your cat can hear more than one sound at a time, and can independently rotate each ear 180 degrees, thanks to more than 20 muscles on each side.
People can hear up to 20,000 cycles per second, but cats can hear up to 65,000 cycles. The sound of mice chatter is about 40,000 cycles per second. So the next time your cat perks her ears up and you don't hear anything... well, you figure it out!
Cats don't have to have direct contact in order to actually feel. Cats can judge distances between objects, the width of an opening, and changes in temperature and air pressure. Beneath your cat's skin are sensors that can detect heat and cold, drafts, and slight changes in pressure.
Cats are heat seekers, which explains why they're avid sunbathers. Cats are drawn to heat so much that they've been known to burn their fur before turning away from a heat source.
The noseleather and the paw pads are the most sensitive areas on the cat to the touch. Cats can judge a rise or fall in temperature as minimal as one or two degrees.
Whiskers act like antennae. They help judge distance, and changes in air pressure.
When it's too dark to see well, whiskers are used to navigate. They can be used to judge the size of openings. First the whiskers, then the head. Since the feline collarbone is loose, a cat can crawl through a space the width of its head.
If a cat gets oil or excessive amounts of dirt on its fur, a so called bran bath may be used to remove the dirt and oil from the fur.
Domestic cats are said to be descended from the African wild cat. These cats are hard to distinguish from the domestic tabby, and weight about 9 to 11 lbs.
A hybrid cat is actually a domestic cat crossed with a wild cat. There are various hybrid cat breeds, each of which involves different crosses. A common example is the Bengal cat, which is a domestic crossed with an Asian leopard cat.
According to the Cat Fancier's Association, less than 1% of all domestic cats in the world are pedigreed cats. So, your cat may resemble a particular breed, but if you haven't got the papers to prove it, who knows?!
If you plan to show your cat, then you'll not only need papers for the pedigree, but also certificates of vaccination in order to participate.
Cat fleas will sometimes jump from cats to humans, but they prefer cats. If possible, stick to non-toxic and natural flea killer.
Polydactyl, or "many-toed" cats, have more than the usual number of toes. The polydactyl gene is dominant, and therefore shows if it is present.
The polydactyl feature is common in the Maine Coon cat. Selective breeding has reduced or eliminated this trait from some of the gene pools of certain pedigreed cat lines. There are some people who would like to preserve it, however, such as certain Maine Coon Poly enthusiasts.
The tooth fairy visits your cat at about 5 months old.
House cats often eat grass. Grass adds folic acid to your cat's diet, and may also act as roughage and help her to bring up fur balls.
Average adult female domestic cats need to consume about 200 to 250 calories per day, and males about 250 to 300.
The National Research Council of the National Academy of Sciences estimates that obesity will occur in 25 percent of dogs and cats. My cat Teddie was overweight, but increasing her activity level with regular play sessions worked to bring her weight back in line... better than kitty cat Weight Watchers I'm sure.
Adult cats have 30 teeth.
Cat food creators have tried to make the most premium of premium cat foods. This "mouse flavored" cat food has so far failed all taste tests. Either you can't fool mother nature, or the testers are too finicky.
Cats use their powerful sense of smell to determine the identity of other living things, and to determine who has been in an area before.
Cats will deposit scent markings in order to define territory, and help them feel more secure.
Scratching on trees and other objects is a way of sharpening the claws, but it also serves to deposit a marking scent via the scent glands between the toes.
Domestic cats will spray inside the house if they feel threatened. Insecure cats will spread their scent around this way in order to feel more secure and in command.
Your cat may feel threatened, and compelled to spray, if strange scents are brought into the house on shoes, clothing, or personal items, or if a cat outside is badgering them.
Do not punish your cat for spraying, as this will make her feel more insecure. Instead, try determining the source of the problem and coming up with a solution.
Feliway is a synthetic version (no, it's not extracted or made from cats) of the domestic cat cheek pheromone. Spraying it around the house may relieve tension and make cats feel less aggressive as it simulates the result of cheek rubbing.
There are over 30 species of the mammal known as the cat - 37 to be exact, of which, the Domestic Cat, or House Cat, is one.
As are all 37 species of cat, it is a member of the Family Felidae, Order Carnivora.
The Egyptian Mau, domesticated thousands of years ago,
is the only domestic cat breed recommended by the International Society for Endangered Cats (ISEC).
Cats use their tails not only to express emotion, but also to balance themselves.
Cats can get sunburned (they also can get freckles). Light colored (especially white) cats are particularly susceptible to sunburn. Anywhere there is less hair to protect the animal, especially the tips of the ears, the nose, and the area just above the eyes, is at risk.
Cat urine glows under a black light! But so do many other body fluids from other animals, including human and dog urine. Don't be so quick to blame the cat!
The longest cat whisker on record as of February 15, 2004, measured 16.5 cm (6.5 in).
Ironically, the cat that it belongs to, a brown/black Maine Coon named Ellie, had no whiskers when her owners first adopted her from a shelter in 1997. She was only a few months old and very weak at the time.
It's interesting that the longest domestic cat is also a Maine Coon. Measuring 121.9 cm (48 in) from nose to tail, Leo weighs 15.8 kg (35 lb), and has paws so big they can fit into a size 2 child's shoe!
Cats stalk, hunt, and catch prey (or anything else, even each other, or you!) instinctively. But... associating hunting, killing, and food is a learned behavior. Young cats are typically taught to kill and eat their prey by their mothers.
Some long haired cats prefer to eliminate on a smooth surface, such as the bottom of the litter box, rather than on the litter itself. Typically, they'll move all the litter to one side of the box to expose the bottom, and then cover things up when they are done.
When outdoors, some cats will use a sandbox as a litter box. So be careful out there!
Poinsettia is commonly thought to be a poisonous plant for cats. It is not, however, on the toxic plant list put out by the ASPCA.
Other names for the catnip herb are catmint, catswort, and field balm.
Catnip has been shown in studies to not only repel, but also kill termites!
Catnip as a mosquito repellent? Researchers have determined that nepetalactone is 10 times more effective at repelling mosquitos than DEET - the chemical insect repellent. So, a new slogan may be... "nothing repels mosquitos better than catnip oil!"
Nepetalactone is the name of the essential oil in catnip that gives it its aromatic odor. It's also the stuff that drives cats crazy!
More than 30 percent of homes in the United States have cats.
According to the Virginia Beach (VA, USA) SPCA, a study published in the New England Journal of Medicine showed that there is no correlation between cat ownership and toxoplasmosis infection.
The primary means by which humans contract toxoplasmosis is NOT contact with cats or cat feces - it is by eating raw or undercooked meat. This is exemplified by the extremely high rate of infection in France. Toxoplasmosis also may be contracted through contact with contaminated soil, although this is more likely in developing countries.
Guinness World Records no longer accepts entries for "heaviest cat." This, and other records have been eliminated due to ethical issues. It seems that people were feeding their animals unhealthy amounts of food in order to beat the record.
All kittens are born with blue eyes and don't develop their true eye color that they will have as adults until they're about 3 months old.
All kittens are born with their eyes closed and don't open them until they are between 6 and 12 days old, with some Siamese cats having been known to open them in only 2 days. They can't actually see until about 2 or 3 days after they open their eyes.
At about 10 weeks of age, a kitten's sense of sight is fully developed.
Kittens use their paws to rhythmically tread and put pressure on the mother's belly. This kneading action massages the mother cat's breasts and stimulates the release of milk.
Adult cats repeat this kneading action, often when they are purring and seem content. We don't know why adult cats do this for certain. Perhaps there is some residual memory of kittenhood, or maybe it's just a built-in physical response.
Newborn kittens have no way of regulating their own body temperature. Blind and deaf, they follow their sense of smell (and possibly vibrating purrs) to reach their mother to suckle. They rely on momma cat and piling on top of each other to stay warm. When they're too warm, they spread out to cool off.
When they are about 3 weeks old, kittens begin grooming each other and their mother. Among friendly cats, this mutual grooming behavior carries into adulthood.
Although they may number up to 15, the average litter of domestic cats is 4.
Siamese cats often have large litter sizes (above 4).
A mother cat will ordinarily begin to wean kittens by refusing them milk somewhere between 6 and 8 weeks of age.
"Morris" is a finicky cat. To prevent kittens from becoming finicky adults, offer a wide variety of foods at a young age.
Once a kitten starts eating solid food (about 6 weeks of age), you can start wiping different types of foods on their lips so they'll lick it off. Continue offering a varied meal plan as they age.
To get kittens adjusted to specific feeding times, give them 10 to 15 minutes to consume their food, then take it away.
Cats enjoy four toes at the rear paws while five toes at the front paws.
Baby cats are known as kittens and they often do not open their eyes until 9 days from their birth. The initial color of babys eyes is blue and varies as it reaches few months old.
Majority of cats do not have eyelashes.
Every cat is unable to witness things right beneath his nose and due to which little crumbs usually gets away with the eyes of these animals.
There are quite a few white cats with blue eyes that are unable to hear while those having orange eyes can hear.
Cats have this capacity to bounce far above the ground at 7 times their own height.
As you generally observe cats leaping very high and landing easily on the ground, this is mainly due to the power of their footpads taking in all the jolts that may arise as a result of dive.
A female cat gets heavy with child within 2 months.
Surprisingly, most of the cats not getting any younger are prone to have cancer.
Unlike humans, cats have a need of fat which they fulfill solely through their food intake.
Chocolate may be sweet and mouthwatering for humans, but not for cats. It is highly toxic for them.
Normally each cat gobbles around 5 mice or corresponding amount of food.
Like humans, cats also possess blood groups AB.
You may have come across few persons who are really hypersensitive to cats. Thats because these persons are actually sensitive to their spit or saliva which can be easily avoided if cats have bath on a regular basis.
A veterinarian must wipe cats teeth at least one time on annual basis because they cause to undergo dental problems if not spruced up properly.
African Wild Cat is the grandparent of all these cats.
You know there was a time in ancient Egypt when if you slay a cat, it was considered such a big offense that they would give you a death penalty.
In the course of Festival of Saint John (Middle Ages), people used to burn up several cats while they were breathing in Town Squares.
Cats have very strange abilities and sometimes you feel that if you leave a cat somewhere far off your residence, even then he shows up. Thats because the nature has bestowed these little creatures with a wonderful bionetwork clock. With the help of this clock, magnetic field of the Earth and the precise face of the sun, cats are able to track down their dwelling or destination where they came from. However if you leave your home then its not possible for a cat to locate you. Isnt it one of the amazing cat facts for kids?
Typically cats nod off for about 18 hours every day but they are not inattentive while asleep.
Since a tap water contains chlorine so it hurts various delicate sections of the cat. Therefore its best to let the tap water down for about 1 day and then allow him to sip.
Abraham Lincoln, the American President domesticated 4 cats in the White House because he stuck on them. One of the funniest cat facts for kids is that even though Napoleon, Julius Ceasar and Charles XI were quite courageous but scared of these little creatures.
Another one of the amazing cat facts for kids is that domestic cats are the only species among the entire class that keep their tails in an upright posture during strolling whereas the rest always keeps their tails straight. Likewise, if a cat is keeping its tail fixed in an upright position, it means he is in high spirits. This tail is very essential for a cat to keep himself in equilibrium. Thats why around 10 percent of bones are present in it.
Unlike humans, you can feel the pulse of a cat by touching the inner part of their back leg thigh and 150 beats/min are considered natural.
All the cats growl except Jaguars.
Likewise, all cats can fold its claws except Cheetahs.
Cats can run at a speed of almost 50 km/h.
One of the astonishing cat facts for kids is that in ancient Egypt where there was a lot of respect for cats at the time, as a cat departs, each member of the family circle use to trim his/her eyebrows for the sake of grief.
The whiskers of a cat are extremely useful for him to navigating and locating the area around him (just like our radar system).
